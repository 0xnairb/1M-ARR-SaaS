## Pricing Validation

### Pricing Research Methods

#### Method 1: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Ask these 4 questions:

1. "At what price would you consider this too expensive?" $_____
2. "At what price would you consider this a bargain?" $_____
3. "At what price would you begin to question the quality?" $_____
4. "At what price would you consider it expensive, but still worth considering?" $_____

**Analysis**:
- Plot responses
- Find "optimal price point" where most overlap
- This gives you a price range

#### Method 2: Tier Testing

Present 3 pricing tiers and ask:
- "Which tier would you choose?"
- "Why?"
- "What would make you upgrade to the next tier?"

**Example**:
```
[ ] Starter - $99/month
    - Feature A
    - Feature B
    - 5 users

[ ] Pro - $299/month
    - Everything in Starter
    - Feature C
    - Feature D
    - 15 users

[ ] Enterprise - $999/month
    - Everything in Pro
    - Feature E
    - Unlimited users
    - Priority support
```

#### Method 3: Value-Based Pricing Calculator

**Formula**:
```
1. Value delivered per month = $_____
2. Your price (10-30% of value) = $_____ - $_____
3. Competitive benchmark = $_____
4. Your position = [ ] Premium [ ] Market [ ] Budget
5. Recommended price = $_____
```

**Example**:
```
1. Save 20 hours/month at $100/hour = $2,000/month value
2. 10-30% of value = $200-600/month
3. Competitors charge $300-500/month
4. Position: Premium (better features)
5. Recommended: $399-499/month
```

### Pricing Validation Checklist

**Before finalizing pricing**:
- [ ] Interviewed 20+ prospects about pricing
- [ ] Tested 3 different price points
- [ ] Confirmed value delivered is 10x+ price
- [ ] Researched 5+ competitor pricing
- [ ] Calculated CAC and LTV at different prices
- [ ] Tested annual vs monthly preference
- [ ] Identified price sensitivity thresholds

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ <30% say "too expensive"
- ✅ 10%+ willing to pre-pay
- ✅ Price > $50/month (for B2B SaaS)
- ✅ Can articulate clear ROI

## MVP Scope Definition

### The Minimum Viable Product Framework

**MVP ≠ Minimum Features**
**MVP = Minimum *Viable* Product**

Viable = Delivers core value + creates wow moment

### MVP Scoping Exercise

**Step 1: List All Possible Features**

Brainstorm everything your product *could* do:
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________
[Continue to 20-30 features]

**Step 2: Categorize Using MoSCoW**

**Must Have** (product is useless without):
- _________________________________
- _________________________________

**Should Have** (important, but not critical):
- _________________________________
- _________________________________

**Could Have** (nice to haves):
- _________________________________
- _________________________________

**Won't Have** (future versions):
- _________________________________
- _________________________________

**Step 3: Identify the Core Workflow**

The ONE workflow that delivers 80% of the value:

```
User has [problem]
→ User does [action 1]
→ Product does [thing]
→ User does [action 2]
→ User gets [outcome]
→ User sees [measurable result]
```

**Example (Compliance SaaS)**:
```
User has HIPAA compliance question
→ User asks question in plain English
→ Product analyzes question + current policies
→ User reviews recommendations
→ User implements recommendations
→ User gets compliance report
```

**Step 4: Define "Aha Moment"**

The moment when user realizes value:

"The first time a user _____________, they'll understand the value."

**Examples**:
- "...sees their compliance score improve"
- "...automates their first workflow"
- "...generates their first report"
- "...connects their tools and sees data flow"

**Step 5: Reduce to Absolute Minimum**

For each "Must Have" feature, ask:
- Can we do this manually at first? (Concierge MVP)
- Can we fake this with existing tools? (Wizard of Oz)
- Can we build 20% of this that delivers 80% of value?

**The Rule**: If you can cut it and still deliver the "aha moment," cut it.

### MVP Build Time Estimate

**Realistic Timeline**:
- Simple CRUD app: 4-6 weeks
- Integration/automation tool: 6-8 weeks
- Data/analytics platform: 8-12 weeks
- Complex workflow tool: 12-16 weeks

**Be Honest**:
- What you think: 4 weeks
- Reality: 2x that (8 weeks)
- Safe estimate: 3x your estimate (12 weeks)

### MVP Launch Checklist

**Before calling it "done"**:

**Core Functionality**:
- [ ] Core workflow works end-to-end
- [ ] User can sign up
- [ ] User can pay (Stripe integration)
- [ ] User can log in/out
- [ ] User can achieve "aha moment"

**Essential Features**:
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Data persistence (won't lose work)
- [ ] Email notifications (transactional)
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Settings/preferences

**Security Basics**:
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Passwords hashed
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CSRF tokens

**Polish** (don't overdo this):
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error messages (helpful, not cryptic)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (basic)
- [ ] Empty states

**Nice to Haves** (skip for MVP):
- ❌ Beautiful design
- ❌ Animations
- ❌ Dark mode
- ❌ Keyboard shortcuts
- ❌ Advanced features

## Next Steps After Validation

### If Validation Succeeds ✅

**Immediate Actions**:
1. [ ] Thank everyone who participated
2. [ ] Summarize key learnings (write them down!)
3. [ ] Finalize MVP scope
4. [ ] Choose tech stack
5. [ ] Set launch date (8-12 weeks out)
6. [ ] Email list: "We're building this, stay tuned"

**MVP Build Phase**:
- Build in public (share progress weekly)
- Keep talking to prospects
- Refine messaging based on feedback
- Prepare beta launch list

### If Validation is Mixed 🟡

**Reassess**:
1. [ ] Review interview notes for patterns
2. [ ] Identify specific objections
3. [ ] Revise solution or positioning
4. [ ] Do 10 more interviews with changes
5. [ ] Re-test messaging on landing page

**Iterate or Pivot**:
- If problem is real but solution is wrong → Iterate on solution
- If problem isn't severe enough → Pivot to different pain point
- If market is too small → Expand or change market

### If Validation Fails ❌

**Don't build. Instead**:
1. [ ] Document what you learned
2. [ ] Identify why it failed (problem, solution, market?)
3. [ ] Consider pivoting to different market or problem
4. [ ] Start validation process again with new hypothesis

**Remember**: Failed validation saves you 6-12 months of wasted building.

## Validation Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Common Mistakes

**1. Talking to Friends/Family**
- They'll tell you what you want to hear
- They're not real customers
- False validation

**2. Asking Leading Questions**
- "Would you use a tool that solves X?" (They'll say yes)
- Instead: "How do you currently solve X?"

**3. Pitching Instead of Listening**
- You talk 80%, they talk 20% = Bad
- They talk 80%, you talk 20% = Good

**4. Only Talking to People Who Agree**
- Selection bias
- Interview skeptics too

**5. Building Before Validating**
- "If I build it, they will come" (They won't)
- Always validate first

**6. Ignoring Negative Feedback**
- "They just don't get it" (Red flag)
- Listen to objections carefully

**7. Confusing Politeness for Interest**
- "That's interesting" ≠ "I'll pay for that"
- Look for specific commitment

### ✅ Best Practices

**1. Ask Open-Ended Questions**
- "Tell me about..." > "Do you..."
- Let them guide the conversation

**2. Listen for Pain, Not Solutions**
- They'll tell you what they think they need
- Focus on the underlying pain

**3. Look for Intensity**
- "This is annoying" < "This costs us $10K/month"
- Severe pain = willingness to pay

**4. Test Willingness to Pay**
- Don't just ask "would you pay?"
- Ask "would you pre-pay now for early access?"

**5. Document Everything**
- Record interviews (with permission)
- Take detailed notes
- Note exact quotes
