## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### DON'T:
❌ Skip validation and start building
❌ Talk only to friends/family
❌ Build perfect MVP (ship ugly, iterate)
❌ Try all marketing channels at once
❌ Ignore churn to chase growth
❌ Under-price (start high)
❌ Give up after 3 months

### DO:
✅ Validate with 20 real prospects
✅ Build MVPstyle (minimal but valuable)
✅ Ship in 12 weeks, not 6 months
✅ Master one channel before adding more
✅ Fix retention before scaling acquisition
✅ Price based on value (10-30% of ROI)
✅ Persist for 18-24 months
