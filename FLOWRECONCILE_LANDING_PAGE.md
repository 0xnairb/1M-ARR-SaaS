### Problem/Agitation Section

**Section Header**:
```
Tired of This?
```

**Pain Points** (with icons):
```
❌ Spending 10-25 hours every week matching sales to deposits

❌ Mysterious discrepancies between Shopify sales and bank deposits

❌ Trying to track fees from Shopify, Stripe, PayPal across different reports

❌ Manually entering hundreds of transactions into QuickBooks

❌ Never really knowing your true profitability until weeks later

❌ Paying $3,000-5,000/month for a bookkeeper to do this
```

**Impact Statement**:
```
E-commerce businesses waste an average of 25 hours per week
on financial reconciliation.

That's 1,300 hours per year - or $65,000 in labor costs.

There's a better way.
