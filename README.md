## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Building Without Validation
**Symptom**: 6 months of coding, zero customers
**Fix**: Talk to 20 customers BEFORE writing code

### Mistake #2: Targeting Everyone
**Symptom**: Weak positioning, random feature requests
**Fix**: Narrow ICP, say no to bad-fit customers

### Mistake #3: Under-Pricing
**Symptom**: Can't afford customer acquisition
**Fix**: Price based on value (10-30% of value delivered)

### Mistake #4: No Clear Growth Channel
**Symptom**: Random acts of marketing, nothing working
**Fix**: Pick ONE channel, master it, then add second

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Retention
**Symptom**: High churn, leaky bucket
**Fix**: Fix retention before scaling acquisition

### Mistake #6: Over-Engineering
**Symptom**: Perfect architecture, no customers
**Fix**: Ship ugly MVP, iterate based on feedback

### Mistake #7: Giving Up Too Soon
**Symptom**: Pivot after 3 months
**Fix**: Give each idea 6-12 months with validated demand

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I do this solo?
**Yes**, especially if you can code. You'll need to hire for support/marketing eventually, but you can get to $10K-25K MRR solo.

### Do I need VC funding?
**No**. This playbook is designed for bootstrapping. VC is optional and comes with trade-offs.

### How long will it really take?
**18-24 months** from validation to $1M ARR is realistic if you:
- Pick a good market
- Execute consistently
- Don't give up

Fast track: 12-15 months (if you have network, domain expertise, capital)
Slow track: 24-36 months (if you're learning as you go)

### What if I don't have a technical co-founder?
**Options**:
1. Learn to code (3-6 months of focused learning)
2. Hire a developer (budget $50-100K/year or 10-20% equity)
3. Use no-code tools for MVP (Bubble, Webflow, Airtable)
4. Find technical co-founder (give 50% equity)

### What if my market is too competitive?
**Good sign**. Competition validates demand. Focus on:
1. Narrower niche (vertical-specific)
2. Better experience (10x improvement)
3. Different business model (usage-based vs seats)
4. Underserved segment (SMB vs enterprise)

### What if I fail?
**Most likely outcome**: You'll learn more in 12 months than 5 years at a job. Even if this venture doesn't hit $1M ARR, you'll have:
- Deep understanding of SaaS business
- Real product shipped
- Customers who paid you
- Skills to do it again (better)

**Best approach**: Minimize downside, maximize learning.
