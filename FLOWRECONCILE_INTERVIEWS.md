## Problem Interview Script

**Goal**: Understand current process, pain severity, attempted solutions

### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

```
"Thanks so much for taking the time to chat!

As I mentioned, I'm researching how e-commerce businesses handle
financial reconciliation - you know, matching Shopify sales to Stripe
deposits, syncing with QuickBooks, that whole process.

There are no right or wrong answers - I'm just trying to understand
how people currently handle this and what's working or not working.

Is it okay if I take notes?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Great! Let's dive in."
```

### Part 2: Current Process Discovery (8 minutes)

**Question 1: Overall Process**
```
"First, can you walk me through your current process for reconciling
your e-commerce finances? Like, from when a sale happens on Shopify
to when it shows up correctly in QuickBooks?"

[Listen carefully, take detailed notes]
[Don't interrupt - let them talk]

Follow-ups if needed:
- "How often do you do this - daily, weekly, monthly?"
- "Who does this? You, a bookkeeper, an accountant?"
- "What tools or systems do you use?"
```

**Question 2: Time Investment**
```
"About how much time does this reconciliation process take you per week or month?"

Follow-ups:
- "Is that just you, or does it involve other people too?"
- "Does it vary? Like, is month-end closing way more time?"
```

**Question 3: Pain Points**
```
"What's the most frustrating part of this process?"

[After they answer, probe deeper]

"Tell me more about that..."
"How does that impact you/your business?"

Common pain points to listen for:
- Time-consuming manual work
- Errors/discrepancies
- Delayed visibility into profitability
- Multiple payment gateways (Stripe + PayPal + etc)
- Refunds and chargebacks
- Fee tracking (Shopify fees, Stripe fees, etc)
- Multi-currency
```

**Question 4: Attempted Solutions**
```
"What have you tried to make this easier or faster?"

Follow-ups:
- "Why did you try that?"
- "Did it help? What worked and what didn't?"
- "Are you still using it? Why or why not?"
```

**Question 5: Cost of Problem**
```
"If this problem just went away - like, if reconciliation happened
automatically and perfectly - what would that be worth to you?"

Alternative framing:
- "How much time would that save per week/month?"
- "What would you do with that time instead?"
- "How much are you currently spending trying to solve this?"
  (bookkeeper hours, tools, etc)
```

### Part 3: Solution Validation (5 minutes)

**Transition**:
```
"This is super helpful. Based on what I'm hearing from you and others,
I'm exploring building a tool that automatically syncs Shopify, Stripe,
and QuickBooks - so reconciliation just happens in the background.

Can I describe what I'm thinking and get your reaction?"
```

**Solution Description**:
```
"Basically, you'd connect your Shopify store, your payment processor
like Stripe, and QuickBooks. Then every day, the tool automatically:

1. Pulls all your orders, fees, refunds from Shopify
2. Pulls all your payouts and charges from Stripe
3. Matches everything up perfectly
4. Creates the journal entries in QuickBooks

You'd just log in and see that everything's reconciled. Takes maybe
5 minutes to set up, then it runs on autopilot.

What's your reaction to that?"

Follow-ups:
- "Would you use something like that?"
- "What concerns or questions do you have?"
- "What would you need to see to trust it?"
- "What's missing from what I described?"
```

**Pricing Exploration**:
```
"If something like this existed today, what would you expect
to pay for it per month?"

[Let them answer first]

"Interesting. What if it was [pick a number based on their answer,
either $99, $199, or $299]/month?"

Follow-ups:
- "Too high, too low, or about right?"
- "What would make it worth that price?"
- "Would you pay annually for a discount?"
```

### Part 4: Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

**Commitment Check**:
```
"Last question: If I built this and it worked as described, would
you be interested in trying it - even as an early beta version?"

If YES:
"Awesome! Can I add you to my early access list? I'll email you
when it's ready - probably in about 8-10 weeks."

If MAYBE:
"What would you need to see or know to be a yes?"

If NO:
"No worries! Can I ask what would hold you back?"
```

**Thank You**:
```
"This has been incredibly helpful - thank you so much for your time!

I'll send over that $25 coffee card today. And if you think of
anything else or have questions, feel free to email me anytime."

[If they agreed to early access]
"I'll be in touch when we have something to show you. Thanks again!"
```

## Solution Interview Script (After MVP Built)

**Goal**: Show product, gather feedback, convert to beta users

### Part 1: Intro & Recap (2 minutes)

```
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for chatting again.

Last time we talked, you mentioned [specific pain point they had].
I wanted to show you what we've built and get your honest feedback.

This is still pretty early, so not everything is perfect - but I'd
love to walk you through it and see what you think.

Sound good?"
```

### Part 2: Product Demo (8 minutes)

**Screen share and walk through**:

```
"So this is FlowReconcile. Let me show you how it works...

[Show homepage]
Here's the landing page. When you sign up, you'd connect your accounts.

[Show connection flow]
Click 'Connect Shopify' - it opens a secure OAuth window where you
authorize access. Same for Stripe and QuickBooks. Takes about 2 minutes total.

[Show dashboard after connection]
Once connected, the dashboard shows the status of everything.
You can see the last sync happened 5 minutes ago, and the next one
is scheduled.

[Show reconciliation summary]
Here's a summary of the last 30 days - total sales, fees, refunds,
and what actually hit your bank account.

[Show reconciliation detail]
Click into any reconciliation to see the details - every order matched
to the Stripe charge and payout.

[Show QuickBooks integration]
And this is what it looks like in QuickBooks - journal entry created
automatically with all the details.

That's the basic flow. What do you think?"
```

**Get Feedback**:
```
- "Is this what you expected?"
- "What confuses you or seems unclear?"
- "What's missing that you'd need?"
- "Would this solve your problem?"
```

### Part 3: Objection Handling (5 minutes)

**Common Objections & Responses**:

**"How do I know it's accurate?"**
```
"Great question. You can review every reconciliation before it posts
to QuickBooks. We also show you a detailed breakdown of what got matched.

And we have a reconciliation report you can compare to your bank statement.

Would that give you confidence?"
```

**"What if something goes wrong?"**
```
"We have a manual override for anything that doesn't match automatically.
Plus, we keep an audit log of every change.

And our support team can help troubleshoot any issues. For beta users,
you'll have my direct email."
```

**"I use [X tool] that's not supported yet"**
```
"Thanks for bringing that up. We're building our roadmap based on
customer demand. If we add [X tool], would you be interested in using us?"

[Add to feature request list]
```

**"This seems expensive"**
```
"I hear you. What are you paying now for bookkeeping/reconciliation?"

[Usually they say $1,000-5,000/month or huge time investment]

"Right. So at $[price]/month, you'd save $[their cost - our price] per month.
Plus get real-time visibility instead of waiting for your bookkeeper."

"Does that ROI make sense?"
```

### Part 4: Close (3 minutes)

**Trial Offer**:
```
"So here's what I'd love to offer you:

14-day free trial - full access to everything
After that, it's $199/month

BUT, since you're an early supporter and helped us build this,
I want to give you 50% off for life - so $99/month forever.

Want to give it a shot?"
```

**If YES**:
```
"Awesome! I'm going to send you an invite link right now.
You'll be able to connect everything and run your first sync today.

I'll check in with you in 3 days to see how it's going. And you
have my email if anything comes up.

Sound good?"
```

**If NO**:
```
"No worries. Can I ask what would change your mind? Is it the price,
the features, timing, or something else?"

[Listen and take notes]

"Totally understand. Can I follow up in a month or two when we've
added [feature they mentioned]?"
```
