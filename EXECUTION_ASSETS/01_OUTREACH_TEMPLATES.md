Subject: Quick question about e-commerce accounting

Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and saw you're running [Store Name] - congrats
on building that business!

I'm researching a problem I keep hearing about from e-commerce operators:
the pain of reconciling Shopify sales to Stripe/QuickBooks. Seems like
everyone's spending 10-20+ hours/month on it.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share how you currently
handle this? No sales pitch - I'm genuinely just trying to understand the
problem better.

Happy to send a $25 Starbucks card as thanks for your time!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Found you through [mutual connection/search/group] - hope that's okay!

or next, I'd really appreciate learning from your experience.

Again, happy to send you a coffee card for your time.

Thanks!

## Reddit Templates

### Template 1: Genuine Question (Build rapport first)

**Post in r/shopify, r/ecommerce**:

```
Title: How do you handle Shopify to QuickBooks reconciliation?

Hey everyone,

I run a [size] e-commerce store and I'm spending 10-15 hours a month
matching Shopify sales to Stripe deposits and entering everything into
QuickBooks.

The process:
1. Export Shopify orders
2. Export Stripe payouts
3. Match them in a spreadsheet
4. Account for fees, refunds, chargebacks
5. Create journal entries in QB
6. Hope I didn't make any mistakes 😅

This can't be the best way. How do you all handle this?

Any tools or processes that work well?

TIA!
```

**When people respond**:
```

## Facebook Group Posts

### Template 1: Question Post

**Post in e-commerce/Shopify groups**:

```
Question for the group: How do you handle financial reconciliation?

I'm spending way too much time matching Shopify sales to Stripe deposits
and entering everything into QuickBooks. There has to be a better way.

Current process:
- Export CSV from Shopify
- Export CSV from Stripe
- Match in Excel
- Manually create QB entries
- Cross fingers I didn't mess up

Takes me ~15 hours per month for a $2M store.

What do you all use? Or do you just hire a bookkeeper to deal with it?
```

## Shopify Community Forum Post

### Template: Help Request

```
Title: Best way to sync Shopify to QuickBooks automatically?

Body:

Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice on automating our Shopify → QuickBooks workflow.

Currently doing everything manually:
- Shopify orders (export)
- Shopify Payments payouts (export)
- Stripe transactions (export)
- Matching everything in Excel
- Creating journal entries in QB

For context:
- ~1,500 orders/month
- $150K revenue/month
- Using both Shopify Payments and Stripe
- QuickBooks Online

Takes me about 15 hours/month and I'm bound to make mistakes.

Questions:
1. What apps/tools are people using for this?
2. Anyone tried A2X or LinkMyBooks? Worth it?
3. Better to just hire a bookkeeper?

Any insights appreciated!
```
