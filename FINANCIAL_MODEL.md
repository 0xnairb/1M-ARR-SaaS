## Financial Model Assumptions

### Pricing Strategy

**Tier Structure**:
| Tier | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Target % of Customers |

| Pro | $299 | $2,990 (2 mo free) | 60% |
| Enterprise | $999 | $9,990 (2 mo free) | 10% |

**Blended ARPA** (Average Revenue Per Account):
- Monthly: (0.3 × $99) + (0.6 × $299) + (0.1 × $999) = **$309/month**
- Annual: $309 × 12 = **$3,708/year**

**Customers Needed for $1M ARR**:
- $1,000,000 / $3,708 = **270 customers**

- Months 7-12: 15% MoM (scaling)
- Months 13-18: 12% MoM (sustained growth)
- Months 19-24: 10% MoM (mature growth)

**Churn Rate**:
- Months 1-3: 15% (early, high churn)
- Months 4-6: 10% (improving product)

## Scenario Analysis

### Best Case Scenario (30% faster growth)

**Assumptions**:
- 20% higher conversion rates
- 2% lower churn
- Same CAC efficiency

**Results**:
- Month 12 MRR: **$90,828** (vs $69,867)
- Month 24 MRR: **$481,757** (vs $370,582)
- Month 24 ARR: **$5.78M** (vs $4.45M)
- Time to $100K MRR: **Month 15** (vs Month 20)

### Base Case Scenario (as modeled above)

**Results**:
- Month 12 MRR: **$69,867**
- Month 24 MRR: **$370,582**
- Month 24 ARR: **$4.45M**
- Time to $100K MRR: **Month 20**

### Worst Case Scenario (slower growth, higher churn)

**Assumptions**:
- 20% lower conversion rates
- 3% higher churn
- 20% higher CAC

**Results**:
- Month 12 MRR: **$48,707** (vs $69,867)
- Month 24 MRR: **$185,291** (vs $370,582)
- Month 24 ARR: **$2.22M** (vs $4.45M)
- Time to $100K MRR: **Month 28** (vs Month 20)
- Risk: May need additional funding

## Cash Flow Management

### Monthly Cash Flow Projection

**Key Principle**: Cash flow is king. Revenue ≠ Cash.

**Cash Flow Drivers**:
1. **Collections**: When customers actually pay
   - Monthly: Billed monthly, paid same month
   - Annual: Billed annually, paid upfront (cash boost)
2. **Expenses**: Paid monthly
3. **CAC Timing**: Marketing spend leads revenue by 30-60 days

### Cash Flow Analysis

| Phase | Cash In (Monthly) | Cash Out (Monthly) | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative Cash |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Month 1-3** | $3,126/mo avg | $1,233/mo avg | $1,893/mo | $5,679 |
| **Month 4-6** | $11,692/mo avg | $5,503/mo avg | $6,189/mo | $24,246 |
| **Month 7-12** | $46,797/mo avg | $21,013/mo avg | $25,784/mo | $178,950 |
| **Month 13-24** | $165,438/mo avg | $51,006/mo avg | $114,432/mo | $1,552,134 |

**Annual Billing Impact**:
- Month 12: 50% annual mix = ~$420K in prepaid annual revenue
- Month 24: 70% annual mix = ~$1.8M in prepaid annual revenue
- **Benefit**: Strong cash position for reinvestment

### Recommended Cash Reserves

**Phase-Appropriate Runway**:
- **Months 1-6**: Maintain 6 months runway (bootstrap-friendly)
- **Months 7-12**: Maintain 9 months runway (scaling phase)
- **Months 13-24**: Maintain 12 months runway (insurance)

**When to Raise Capital** (if needed):
- If runway drops below 6 months
- If opportunity to 3x growth with capital
- If CAC payback exceeds available cash runway

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Time to Break-Even

**Cumulative Break-Even**: Month 7-8
- Total revenue exceeds total expenses
- After this point, business is self-sustaining

**Monthly Break-Even**:
| Month | Monthly Expenses | Revenue Needed | Customers Needed |
|-------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 6 | $8,510 | $8,510 | 28 |
| 12 | $26,080 | $26,080 | 84 |
| 24 | $64,575 | $64,575 | 209 |

**Operating Leverage**:
- As revenue grows, profit margin expands (from 16% to 66%)
- This is the SaaS magic: high fixed costs, low variable costs

---

## Funding Requirements

### Bootstrap Path (Recommended)

**Initial Capital Needed**: $20,000-$50,000
- Covers 6-12 months of minimal operating expenses
- Assumes founder works without salary initially
- Focus on capital-efficient growth

**Sources**:
- Personal savings
- Credit cards (if confident)
- Pre-sales/pilot revenue
- Small angel check ($25K-50K)

**Milestone-Based Withdrawal**:
- Months 1-6: $0 founder salary
- Months 7-12: $3K-5K/month
- Months 13+: Market salary as profits allow

### Venture Path (If Pursuing)

**Seed Round Timing**: After $50K MRR (Month 11-13)
**Typical Seed Round**: $500K-$1.5M
**Valuation Range**: $3M-$6M (at $50K MRR)
**Use of Funds**:
- 60%: Sales & marketing
- 25%: Product development (team)
- 15%: Operations & overhead

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Faster growth
- ✅ Reduced personal risk
- ❌ Dilution (~15-25%)
- ❌ Investor expectations
- ❌ Loss of control

## Revenue Model Deep Dive

### Revenue Composition by Type

**Month 12 Revenue Mix**:
| Revenue Type | Amount | % of Total |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| **New MRR** | $17,906 | 26% |
| **Existing MRR** | $47,496 | 68% |
| **Expansion MRR** | $4,465 | 6% |
| **Total** | $69,867 | 100% |

**Month 24 Revenue Mix**:
| Revenue Type | Amount | % of Total |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| **New MRR** | $61,917 | 17% |
| **Existing MRR** | $264,424 | 71% |
| **Expansion MRR** | $44,241 | 12% |
| **Total** | $370,582 | 100% |

**Key Insight**: As you mature, new revenue becomes smaller % of total. Retention and expansion become critical.

### Pricing Tier Performance

**Expected Distribution** (Month 12):
| Tier | Customers | MRR per Tier | % of Total MRR |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Starter ($99) | 77 | $7,623 | 11% |
| Pro ($299) | 153 | $45,747 | 65% |
| Enterprise ($999) | 25 | $24,975 | 36% |

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Move Starter → Pro (upsell)
- Move Pro → Enterprise (expansion)
- Add seat expansion within tiers

---

## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Core Assumptions

1. **Conversion Rates**:
   - Trial → Paid: 20%
   - Visitor → Trial: 3%
   - Implies: Need 1,667 visitors per customer

2. **Retention**:
   - First 90 days: 70% retention
   - After 90 days: 95% monthly retention
   - Annual retention: 60% (industry avg: 50-70%)

3. **Growth Channels**:
   - Months 1-6: Founder-led (no scalable channel yet)
   - Months 7-12: One scalable channel identified
   - Months 13-24: Multi-channel growth engine

### Key Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Higher Churn Than Expected**
- **Impact**: Revenue grows slower, need more customers
- **Mitigation**: Focus on retention before acquisition, improve onboarding
- **Circuit Breaker**: If churn >10% for 3 months, pause growth and fix product

**Risk 2: Higher CAC Than Modeled**
- **Impact**: Unit economics break, profitability delayed
- **Mitigation**: Test multiple channels, optimize conversion funnel
- **Circuit Breaker**: If CAC >$800, shift to capital-efficient channels

**Risk 3: Lower Conversion Than Expected**
- **Impact**: Need more traffic, higher CAC
- **Mitigation**: Improve product positioning, trial experience, sales process
- **Circuit Breaker**: If conversion <10%, revisit product-market fit

**Risk 4: Slower Growth Rate**
- **Impact**: Longer time to $1M ARR
- **Mitigation**: Increase marketing spend (if profitable), improve product
- **Circuit Breaker**: If flat for 3+ months, consider pivot

**Risk 5: Competitive Pressure**
- **Impact**: Price compression, higher CAC
- **Mitigation**: Differentiate on value, verticalize, build moat
- **Circuit Breaker**: If forced to drop prices >30%, reassess market
